The following recommendations are general guidelines that will assist in reducing exposure to infectious diseases in the commission of EMS treatment of patients. Follow immunization recommendations from Centers for Disease Control Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) (e.g., Hepatitis B and Flu vaccinations) Always be prepared for isolation from body substances (blood, respiratory secretions, sputum, saliva, emesis, fecal matter). Wear examination gloves and eye protection during patient care activities. If patient conditions tolerate, reduce exposure of suspected infectious respiratory droplets by covering the patient’s nose and mouth in oxygen administration (e.g., non-rebreather mask) or with a face mask (e.g., surgical type face mask) if oxygen administration is not required. When providing airway assessment and management, maximize the functional distance between the patient’s nose and mouth and the EMS professional’s nose and mouth. The greater the possible distance, the lesser the risk of respiratory illness transmission. Wear appropriate body substance isolation (eye splash protection, mask over nose/mouth, gloves as previously noted, gown to protect personal uniform contamination) as patient suspected illness/injury may dictate. During treatment of the patient, avoid likely trajectories of bleeding, coughing, spitting, vomiting, defecating whenever possible. Exercise extremely diligent action when handling or around the handling of contaminated sharps (e.g., IV/IO needles, needle/syringe, glucometer lancets) and have appropriate sharps container readily present. Full sharps containers should be disposed of at the infectious waste collection area on campus, at the back dock of George R. Brown Hall. For all exposures, wash exposed area(s) as soon as possible with copious irrigation and/or antibacterial solution approved for that area(s) use. In the event of exposure, follow general principles as listed in Post-Exposure Prophylaxis Recommendations. Do not delay in reporting and seeking treatment for an infectious disease/body substance exposure of concern. Hand washing with soap and water should be done by all patient care providers after each call. Cleaning supplies are available in EMS responder vehicles, at RUPD, and at the Duncan EMS room. Patient care equipment should be cleaned after every call, with particular attention to frequently used items such as vital signs equipment, clipboards, and radios. Contact the Operations Lieutenant for any needed cleaning supplies. ‌Post-Exposure Prophylaxis Recommendations Rice University Emergency Medical Services Clinical Guidelines Preventing an exposure is always better than the “cure” for an exposure. Despite careful practices, EMS professionals can experience at least one concerning infectious disease exposure in a career. The following recommendations are general guidelines that can assist in post-exposure evaluation and PEP care: Wash exposed area(s) as soon as possible with copious irrigation and/or antibacterial solution approved for that area(s) use. Gather as much information about the exposure of concern as possible – what body substance (e.g., blood, saliva), what route of exposure, timing/amount of exposure, patient demographics, and any related infectious disease medical history of the patient (e.g., known HIV or Hepatitis C?). Do not delay in reporting and seeking treatment for an infectious disease/body substance exposure of concern. Regardless of time of day or day or week, seek direction from the appropriate EMS supervisor. Contact the InCharge present on the call, the EMS Captain or Senior Lieutenant, and/or the EMS Director immediately after the patient’s care can be transferred to other healthcare providers. Rice EMS Medical Command will be consulted for appropriate follow up care. Time to treatment (in hours) is of the essence to reduce transmission of infectious disease. Additional information on PEP care can be obtained at the following website: http://nccc.ucsf.edu/clinician-consultation/pep-post-exposure-prophylaxis/ Complete a First Report of Injury/Illness form, located on the Rice University Risk Management website. This form should be returned to the EMS Director. ‌Informed Patient Consent & Refusal Rice University Emergency Medical Services Clinical Guidelines Criteria Refusal = when competent patient refuses treatment and/or transport to advanced health care facility after being informed of suspected medical condition, type of treatment rendered and consequences and possible risks of treatment and refusal of treatment or transport Mental capacity of adult (>18 years old) patient. Capacity should be noted to include the following: Ability to communicate a choice concerning medical evaluation, treatment and/or transport Ability to understand relevant information about treatment/plan Ability to appreciate the significance of the information in this circumstance, by communicating understanding of risks and benefits Ability to use reasoning to select a choice (Pediatric) Mental competence of adult (>18 years old) caretaker as defined above General All personnel must have consent (either implied or informed) before treating a patient. Any adult of mental capacity or guardian may either consent to or refuse treatment/transport for themselves (adult) or patient for whom they are responsible (pediatric) Any police officer may order treatment or transportation of any prisoner in their custody Any patient may be transported against their will if the EMT has court order for patient to receive treatment or if the patient is in the custody of a law enforcement officer. Mentally incompetent patient or patients without the capacity to refuse Patients can be considered by either courts or by definition of policy may be treated under implied consent. If patient refuses to be treated/transported, RUPD may be notified to safely restrain patient. Refusal Any competent adult has the right to refuse treatment, even if that lack of treatment may result in death. Any patient refusing treatment or transport shall be informed of the possible consequences of that refusal and shall sign a refusal form. Individuals other than REMS personnel should sign as a witness the patient’s refusal, if possible. Any EMT who does not feel comfortable with a patient refusing treatment or transport because the EMT feels that the refusal may result in death or serious injury shall contact the EMS Director and/or an EMS Medical Director. Implied consent: the assumption that, in a true emergency where a patient who is unresponsive or unable to make a rational decision is at significant risk of death, disability, or deterioration of condition, that patient would agree to emergency treatment. Informed consent: consent for treatment that is given by a competent patient based on a full disclosure of possible risks and benefits. Prehospital Emergency Care, 10th Edition. Mistovich, Joseph J. Pearson Education, © 2014. All patients that REMS providers meet for an EMS call will be offered evaluation and transport to the emergency room. For patients who choose not to go to the emergency room by ambulance, a refusal form must be signed. This should be signed by the patient in most cases. Exceptions: If the patient is less than 18 years old, the patient’s parent or guardian may sign on their behalf if they are present on scene. If there is no parent or guardian on scene, the EMS provider should make a reasonable attempt to contact a parent or guardian on the phone to verify consent and refusal. If no parent or guardian is available on scene or on the phone, RUPD or a University official such as a College Master, Resident Assistant, or Athletics personnel such as a coach or trainer may be asked to sign on the minor’s behalf. In the case that no one is willing to sign on the minor’s behalf, Medical Command should be contacted for direction. A patient must be awake and alert, with a reasonable understanding of what the form states, to qualify to sign the refusal form. The EMS provider should review the information on the form with the patient, and then ask to check the patient understands what they are signing. Patients who are unable to understand the form, recall the information on the form, and/or who are physically unable to sign the form, should be reevaluated for competency. A patient who has a physical injury to an arm or hand that would make signing painful or difficult may choose to not sign the form. RUPD or a University Official should be requested to witness the patient’s acknowledgement of the refusal of ambulance transport. In the case of a patient who refuses to sign the form, RUPD or a University Official should be requested to respond to the scene to witness that EMS offered treatment and/or transport, but the patient refused these options, and refused to sign the form.","source":"clinical-guidelines-wotoc.html","nodeIndex":13,"xpath":"/html/body/ol/li[4]","tagName":"li","bookmark":"bookmark2"}],[14,{"id":"node_14","text":"Patients should also be requested to sign the refusal form for refusal of specific interventions.

Hand washing with soap and water should be done by all providers after each call. Contact with the patient should be minimized when possible. See Isolation Housing SOP for response procedures. Equipment should also be placed in the hallway at a safe distance away from the patient. Treatment should be limited to interview and destination planning as much as possible. If additional care is needed, the steps below can be considered for patients in moderate to severe distress.

Signs may include wheezing, poor air movement with labored effort, and/or diminished lung sounds. Patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) may present with wheezing but the problem is from cardiac etiology. Albuterol will not help and should not be administered in this case. Environmental: Cold Illness Rice University Emergency Medical Services Clinical Guidelines Criteria Although Houston has a generally temperate climate, cold illness/injury should remain a concern for patients found out of doors in the winter months. Hypothermia can occur with brief exposure to cold weather, and with prolonged exposure in ambient temperatures as high as 50 – 60℉, particularly if the patient is wet from rain or other environmental conditions.

Heat illness may be the primary cause of the emergency or may contribute to or develop with other medical or traumatic conditions. Heat illness may progress quickly to a life-threatening condition. Stages of heat illness include: Heat Cramps: Minor muscle cramps usually in the legs and abdominal wall. Temperature is normal. Heat Exhaustion: May include weakness, vertigo, nausea/vomiting, tachycardia, profuse sweating, and/or syncope. Temperature may be normal or 1 – 2° elevated. Heat Stroke: May include Altered Mental Status, Seizure or other neurological dysfunction, may be without sweating. Temperature ≥ 104℉. ‌Treatment EMT AEMT Manage CABCs Remove patient from hot environment Remove clothing as needed Active cooling with continuous temperature monitoring: Move to air conditioned room Cool body and head with water or saline Fan to promote evaporative cooling Apply ice packs to groin, neck, and axilla Use ice bath if available Obtain vital signs (apply cardiac monitor) Oxygen Administration as appropriate Monitor EtCO2 and Waveform Capnography Consider Supraglottic Airway if indicated and only if BVM ventilations are ineffective Obtain IV access and consider NS administration (use chilled NS if heat stroke suspected) ADULT: IV NS 500 mL bolus, if no signs of pulmonary edema Repeat up to 2 L NS if: Fatigue remains and/or Altered Mental Status remains and/or SBP < 100 mmHg, if no signs of pulmonary edema Paramedic PEDIATRIC: IV NS 20 mL/kg bolus, if no signs of pulmonary edema Repeat up to 60 mL/kg if: Fatigue remains and/or Altered Mental Status remains and/or SBP < (70 + 2x age in years) mmHg, if no signs of pulmonary edema ECG monitoring (see Cardiac Monitor Operation) Fever Rice University Emergency Medical Services Clinical Guidelines Criteria Temperature > 101.3℉ Cold-like symptoms Treatment EMT AEMT Paramedic Obtain vital signs (apply cardiac monitor) Oxygen Administration as appropriate Consider IV access and NS administration ‌ADULT: IV NS TKO if SBP ≥ 100 mmHg without hypotensive symptoms IV NS 250 mL bolus if SBP < 100 mmHg with hypotensive symptoms and no signs of pulmonary edema Repeat up to 2 L NS if SBP remains < 100 mmHg with hypotensive symptoms and no signs of pulmonary edema PEDIATRIC: IV NS TKO if SBP ≥ (70+2x age in years) mmHg without hypotensive symptoms IV NS 20 mL/kg bolus if SBP < (70 + 2x age in years) mmHg with hypotensive symptoms and no signs of pulmonary edema Repeat up to 60 mL/kg if SBP remains < (70 + 2x age in years) mmHg with hypotensive symptoms and no signs of pulmonary edema If patient has nausea and/or vomiting, consider: ADULT: Ondansetron 4-8 mg IV If no history of prolonged QT Syndrome PEDIATRIC: Ondansetron 0.1 mg/kg IV (max 4 mg) If no history of prolonged QT syndrome General Fever with hypotension that is refractory to fluid therapy indicates severe septic shock Do not delay transport, and ensure ALS transport is enroute Hypertensive Emergency Rice University Emergency Medical Services Clinical Guidelines Criteria Symptomatic hypertension Chest pain, dyspnea, or other related symptoms of ischemia Severe headache Treatment EMT ‌AEMT Paramedic Obtain vital signs (apply cardiac monitor) including manual blood pressure Oxygen Administration as appropriate Los Angeles Prehospital Stroke Screen Elevate head to 15° Obtain 12-lead ECG Obtain IV Access If SBP > 180 mmHg and/or DBP > 120 mmHg AND chest pain or dyspnea: ADULT: Nitroglycerin 0.4 mg SL May repeat every 5 min until BP reduced 10% or symptoms resolved DO NOT reduce BP beyond 10% Medical command consult required if patient ≤ 40 years old May be administered as tablets or powders Nitroglycerine is contraindicated in patients with: History of aortic stenosis Use of Viagra (Sildenafil) or Levitra (Vardenafil) within last 24 hrs Use of Cialis (Tadalafil) within last 48 hrs Suspected right sided MI, as it may precipitate hypotension PEDIATRIC: Consult medical command General Do NOT treat asymptomatic hypertension. Do NOT reduce BP in symptomatic hypertension by more than 10%. A hypertensive emergency means end-organ damage and therefore assessment should include ACS, stroke, and renal failure. Neonatal Resuscitation Rice University Emergency Medical Services Clinical Guidelines Criteria Newborn patients who do not respond to initial stimulation and resuscitation Example: weak cry, signs of respiratory distress, poor tone Prompt initial resuscitation steps are critical to the successful outcome of a neonatal resuscitation. Treatment EMT Advanced EMT Position the newborn on their back, with the airway in sniﬃng position. Suction the mouth and then nose using bulb suction if thick meconium or secretions are present Dry the newborn, then place on a dry blanket, cover the head, and keep warm. ‌Provide tactile stimulation if the newborn is not responding to drying Record APGAR score at 1 min. and at 5 min. If the HR < 100 bpm, gasping, or apnea: Positive pressure ventilations with room air at 40 to 60 breaths/min. The primary indicator of eﬀective ventilation is heart rate improvement. Use minimum necessary volume to achieve chest rise and heart rate change. If there is no improvement after 90 seconds, ventilate with oxygen until heart rate normalizes, then reassess. If HR < 60 bpm: Positive pressure ventilations with oxygen at 40 to 60 breaths/min. If no improvements after 30 seconds, begin chest compressions at 3:1 ratio 90 compressions and 30 breaths/min Blood glucose analysis using a heal prick. Hypoglycemia in a newborn is defined as: BGL ≤ 30mg/dL in the first 24 hours of life BGL ≤ 45mg/dL thereafter Treat using the hypoglycemia protocol. If ventilation and heart rate are not improved after 3 minutes of adequate resuscitation: IV Normal Saline 10 mL/kg IV over 5 to 10 minutes If persistent obtundation AND suspicion or evidence of maternal narcotic use: Naloxone 0.1mg/kg IV/IO/IN (Max Dose 0.4 mg) every 5 minutes up to a total of 4 mg Paramedic Continuous ECG monitoring and treat life threatening dysrhythmias as indicated If heart rate < 60 and no chest rise during ventilation, intubate. If the heart rate remains < 60 despite adequate ventilation and chest compressions, consider: Epinephrine [1:10,000] 0.01 mg/kg IV, may be repeated every 3 to 5 minutes if heart rate remains < 60 bpm. Obtain APGAR scores at 1 and 5 minutes of life Obstetric Emergencies Rice University Emergency Medical Services Clinical Guidelines Criteria Obstetric emergencies can include a broad array of conditions found in women of childbearing age. For any female patient with a specific complaint of abdominal pain, vaginal bleeding or discharge, and/or nonspeciﬁc shock/hypotension, an obstetric emergency should be considered. Obtaining pertinent information during a patient interview will help to identify conditions/complaints that should be seen without delay in the emergency room, and conditions/complaints that would be more appropriately seen by the patient’s physician. Maternal changes over the pregnancy can aﬀect a woman’s body: A growing abdomen becomes more prone to injury. Balance and gait may be aﬀected. ‌A pregnant woman’s blood volume increases by almost 50% by the time she reaches term. During pregnancy, the heart rate increases by 10 – 15 bpm. Blood pressure may be lower than normal in the first two trimesters but returns to normal in the third trimester. Hypertension in a pregnant woman should raise suspicion for pre-eclampsia. Increased maternal blood volume delays ﬁndings associated with shock. Slight shortness of breath is a common complaint in late pregnancy. Severe nausea and vomiting (hyperemesis gravidarum) may occur in early pregnancy. Pregnancy causes musculoskeletal joints to loosen – sprains and strains may occur more readily. Concerning ﬁndings that should increase the suspicion of an emergent condition include: Unusually heavy vaginal bleeding (menorrhagia): Saturating a tampon or sanitary napkin as frequently as every hour for more than four hours is signiﬁcant and the patient should be evaluated for hypovolemia/ hemorrhaging shock. Unusual abdominal pain: Severe or unusual abdominal pain may be caused by premature labor, ectopic pregnancy, spontaneous abortion, placenta previa or placental abruption, as well as other abdominal complaints such as appendicitis, kidney stones, etc. Trauma in pregnancy: The increased vascularity of the uterus, as well as other physiologic changes in the pregnant patient, increases the risk of serious maternal injury, and/or fetal distress. Medical command should be consulted as needed for assistance with appropriate destination for patients with obstetric complaints. Note: Remember, two patients = two charts. General Treatment Priorities EMT Supportive care Obtain vital signs (apply cardiac monitor) Rapid transport if needed, position the patient carefully: To prevent supine hypotensive syndrome and further impairment in maternal and fetal perfusion, never position a patient in the third trimester of pregnancy in a supine position for transport. Consider laying the patient on their left side to avoid pressure on the vena cava. Pre-eclampsia/Eclampsia Criteria Pre-eclampsia is the new onset of hypertension and either protein in the urine or end-organ dysfunction after 20 weeks of gestation in a previously normotensive woman. Eclampsia is the development of grand mal seizures in a woman with preeclampsia, in the absence of other neurological conditions that could account for the seizure. Note that eclampsia may occur up to 30 days post-delivery. Indications for preeclampsia/eclampsia: Severe hypertension (SBP ≥ 160 mmHg or DBP ≥ 110 mmHg) Peripheral edema Persistent and/or severe headache Visual abnormalities ‌Upper abdominal pain or epigastric pain Nausea and/or vomiting Dyspnea and/or retrosternal chest pain Altered mental status Treatment EMT AEMT Manage CABCs Obtain vital signs (apply cardiac monitor) Oxygen Administration as appropriate Place patient in left lateral recumbent position if possible If seizing or postictal, treat per Seizures guideline Consider IV access and NS administration ADULT: IV NS TKO if SBP ≥ 100 mmHg without hypotensive symptoms IV NS 250 mL bolus if SBP < 100 mmHg with hypotensive symptoms and no signs of pulmonary edema Repeat up to 1 L NS if SBP remains < 100 mmHg with hypotensive symptoms and no signs of pulmonary edema Vaginal Bleeding Criteria Vaginal bleeding can be caused by: abruptio placenta placenta previa uterine rupture miscarriage postpartum hemorrhage Treatment EMT and transport to the closest appropriate facility. AEMT Manage CABCs Obtain vital signs (apply cardiac monitor) ‌Oxygen Administration as appropriate Positioning: If in the third trimester of pregnancy, place the patient in the left lateral recumbent position. If not in the third trimester and is exhibiting signs/symptoms of hypoperfusion, place the patient in Trendelenburg position. If active postpartum hemorrhage from the vagina, apply a ﬁrm uterine massage starting from the pubis toward the umbilicus clockwise. If miscarriage and the fetus is < 20 weeks in gestation: If pulseless and apneic, do not attempt resuscitation measures for the fetus. If there is any question as to the approximate gestation of the fetus, provide neonatal resuscitative measures. If spontaneous respirations and/or pulses, provide immediate Neonatal Resuscitation If miscarriage and the fetus is ≥ 20 weeks in gestation: Immediate Neonatal Resuscitation Consider IV access and NS administration ADULT: IV NS TKO if SBP ≥ 100 mmHg without hypotensive symptoms IV NS 250 mL bolus if SBP < 100 mmHg with hypotensive symptoms and no signs of pulmonary edema Repeat up to 1 L NS if SBP remains < 100 mmHg with hypotensive symptoms and no signs of pulmonary edema Labor and Delivery Uncomplicated Delivery An important decision to make with patients in labor is whether to attempt delivery in the ﬁeld or transport the patient to the hospital. Factors that affect that decision include: Frequent contractions that are less than 2 minutes apart and lasting 30 – 45 seconds. Crowning or bulging Mother has the urge to push or move her bowels. Do not allow the patient to utilize the toilet.

Elevate buttocks if needed. Carefully assist expulsion of the newborn from the birth canal in its natural progression. Provide gentle pressure with palm to control delivery of the head. Do not pull the newborn. As the head emerges, encourage the mother not to push so that the delivery process can continue slowly and with minimal trauma to the perineal area. Gently guide the head downward (posterior) until the upper (anterior) shoulder delivers. If the cord is wrapped around the newborn’s neck, attempt to unwrap it from the neck. If unable, attach 2 umbilical clamps and cut the cord between the clamps. Gently lift the head upwards (anterior) until the lower (posterior) shoulder delivers. Do not routinely suction the newborn’s mouth and nose to clear secretions, unless there is an obvious airway obstruction or requires positive pressure ventilations. Once delivery is accomplished, position the infant at or slightly below the level of the vagina, clamp the cord at 6” and 8” from the navel, and cut between the clamps. Dry and wrap the newborn in a blanket to preserve body temperature. Note the delivery time and the sex of newborn. Record APGAR score at 1 min and at 5 min post-delivery. Provide immediate Neonatal Resuscitation if necessary. If the placenta is delivered (separation usually occurs within 5 min after delivery), ensure it is transported to the hospital.

Dry severe diaphoresis and remove excessive chest hair prior to placement. Connect Quick-Combo pads to Lifepak 15. Advise patient of impending therapy. ‌Power on the pacing function by pressing the PACER button. Ensure triangular “sense” markers are above each QRS complex. Ensure proper connection if they do not appear. If “sense” markers are present for only some QRS complexes, adjust ECG size or select an alternate monitoring lead to achieve proper tracking. Set pacing rate at 60 paces per minute using either the RATE switch or the SPEED DIAL. Set pacing current at minimum level achieving both electrical AND mechanical capture. Deliver electrical pacing current using either the CURRENT switch or the SPEED DIAL. Do not use the pause button unless directed by medical control. Holding the pause button will decrease pacing rate by 25% while it is depressed. If pacing therapy termination is required, power off the pacing function by pressing the PACER button. Considerations If ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia occurs, pressing the yellow CHARGE button will automatically stop pacing. Proceed with defibrillation. If monitoring leads become detached, pacing continues but in non- demand mode. During this mode, the patient will receive pacemaker activity at the set rate regardless of any intrinsic beats the patient may have. Reattach the monitoring leads to reestablish demand pacing. If the Quik-Combo pads get detached at any time, an alarm will sound. During this disconnection, the pacing function will resume but current will be set automatically at 0 mA. Current will remain at 0 mA until pads are reconnected and the current is manually increased back to its original level. Electrical capture is demonstrated by a QRS complex after each pacer spike followed by a distinct, broad T-wave. Mechanical capture is demonstrated by a palpable pulse after each pacer spike. Ensure that both electrical capture and mechanical capture are achieved. Pacing Pads should ideally be placed on the anterior and posterior chest.

For pediatric synchronized cardioversion, consult medical command for treatment plan and energy settings. Press CHARGE. While the monitor is charging a charging bar appears and a ramping tone sounds, indicating the charging energy level. When the monitor is fully charged, the screen displays the available energy (figure 8). Make certain that all personnel stand clear of the patient, bed, and any equipment connected to the patient. Confirm ECG rhythm. Confirm available energy. Prior to delivering synchronized cardioversion, it is essential to ensure that the SYNC mode message continues to appear. Failure to deliver a “synchronized” cardioversion in this setting could cause ventricular fibrillation arrest in the patient (figure 9).

The point between the junction of two veins is more stable and often easier to use. Start distally and, if successive attempts are necessary, make more proximal attempts. The most difficult problem with IV insertion is to know when to try and when to stop trying. If the procedure is not accomplished after two attempts or two minutes, the AEMT or higher licensed EMS professional must consider expediting other care, including transport to the emergency department. Renal dialysis fistulas and surgically implanted ports should not be used for vascular access. Use IO access in critical patient situations otherwise.

Flow Rates of Different Administration Devices Nasal Cannula: 2 – 6 L/min Nebulizer: 6 – 8 L/min Non-Rebreather Mask: 10 – 15 L/min Bag-Valve Mask: 15 – 20 L/min Considerations Consider all possible causes of respiratory distress. Administration should be directed to achieve oxygen saturation level of 94-98% in patients without chronic pulmonary disorders. Over administration of oxygen has been shown to produce serious adverse outcomes. Do not administer oxygen if SpO2 is greater than 95% on room air with no signs of respiratory distress. Administration of blow-by oxygen via NRB at 10-15 L/min can be achieved by holding the mask near the patient’s nose/mouth. This is a common administration route for pediatric patients who may be averse to having a nasal cannula/mask secured on the face. Consider use of humidified oxygen when using nasal cannula at high flow rates. A BVM connected to 15 L/min of oxygen should be used if the patient is unconscious and unable to breathe, respiratory rate ≤ 8 breaths/minute, or agonal respirations are noted. If the patient is conscious and experiencing profound respiratory distress, consider use of a BVM to give controlled, regular breaths. Be sure to explain procedure to patient and coach him/her to cooperate with the breaths you give, in order to avoid extreme discomfort and exacerbating damage to the lungs. Have the patient breathe with the squeezes of the bag and give oxygen only until chest rise is observed. Oxygen tanks should be replaced when pressure ≤ 500 psi, or some malfunction is detected (air leakage, obstruction to administration). Notify the Operations Lieutenant when switching out an oxygen tank. Bag Valve Mask (BVM) Management Rice University Emergency Medical Services Clinical Guidelines Criteria: Respiratory arrest Inadequate oxygenation or ventilation that is not improved by non-positive pressure methods or immediately obvious that patient will not improve by non-positive pressure methods Technique: Hold the mask using a c/e-clamp formed by one, but preferably, both hands Insert an oropharyngeal and/or nasopharyngeal airway(s) Head-tilt chin lift to place the patient in a sniffing position to open the airway Use the jaw thrust maneuver in suspected spinal cord injuries Place the mask over the mouth and elevate the jaw into the mask, ensuring an adequate seal Consider the Sellick maneuver, if indicated, by putting pressure on the cricoid cartilage to partially occlude the esophagus in the unconscious patient. ‌Do not utilize if ventilations are effective and without onset of gastric distention. Emesis is a distinct possibility after releasing Sellick maneuver. Use high flow, 100% oxygen with BVM ventilations Squeeze the bag slowly and smoothly (over 1 second ventilation periods) delivering adequate ventilation volume to ensure the chest rises (approximately 6 mL/kg of air) and provide adequate exhalation time.
